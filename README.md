## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

- **What are the system requirements to use your project?**

  If you are excited about building web applications with Ruby on Rails, you might be wondering what are the system requirements to use a rails app. Well, the good news is that you don't need a lot of fancy hardware or software to get started. All you need is a computer with a modern operating system, such as Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, and a text editor of your choice. You will also need to install Ruby, which is the programming language that Rails is based on, and Rails itself, which is a framework that provides tools and conventions for web development. You can find detailed instructions on how to install Ruby and Rails on the official website: [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). Once you have Ruby and Rails installed, you are ready to create and run your own rails app!

- **What are the key features of your project and how can I use them?**

  **Hello React Rails** is a simple and funny  web application that showcase how you cam implement an app using React and Rails. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Rails is a Ruby framework for developing web applications. Together, they make a powerful combination that lets you write less code and do more.
